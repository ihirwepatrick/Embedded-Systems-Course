## Overview

As part of my studies at Rwanda Coding Academy, this repository serves as a daily log of programs developed during my embedded systems course. Each folder contains source code and relevant documentation for each day's lessons.

## Structure

The repository is organized by date, with each folder labeled in the format `YYYY-MM-DD` for easy navigation.

## Programs

Each program demonstrates specific concepts, which may include:
- Basic hardware interfacing
- GPIO control
- Interrupt handling
- Timer and PWM utilization
- Sensor interfacing and communication protocols

## Requirements

To compile and run these programs, you may need:
- An embedded system development board (e.g., STM32, Arduino)
- Embedded system development software (e.g., Keil uVision, STM32CubeIDE, Arduino IDE)
- Necessary drivers and libraries

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ihirwepatrick/Embedded-Systems-Course.git
   cd Embedded-Systems-Course

This template is designed to help others follow your progress and understand the purpose and structure of each program you add to the repository. Let me know if you want to add any specific details!
